### About this directory
- `Homework2_answer.pdf` file has all the descriptive answers.
- `Question2.ipynb` and `Question3.ipynb` files have answer codes for each corresponding question.
- _Instead of connecting a data file `Data_Q3.xlsx` for question 3, I coded the data maunally within `Question3.ipynb`._
